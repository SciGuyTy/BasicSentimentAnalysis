# Repository Description
This repository serves as a brief overview of my stage gate one project for CSCI 494-007, National Security Data Science in Action. To demonstrate my competency using Python and related data analysis libraries, I implemented an off-the-shelf neural network using TensorFlow and Keras. Given my inexperience with these two high-level libraries, I followed the ["Basic Text Classification"](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/text_classification) developer guide from the official TensorFlow documentation. This project involved building, training, and evaluating a sequential model for binary sentiment analysis of movie reviews.
